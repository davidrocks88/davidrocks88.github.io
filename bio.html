        <h1> Biography </h1>

<div class="primaryText"> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past three academic semesters, I have been doing academic research, learning new lab instrumentation and research methodology skills. While I have enjoyed my time in the lab, I want to apply the skills I have learned to a product-focused environment with a problem-solving team. My dream career is innovating in the genetic engineering and wearable devices fields. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time, I hang out with my fraternity brothers, tear through my ever-growing mountain of books to read, and cook meals based off of Gordon Ramsay's recipes and videos.</p>
