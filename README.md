This website is a simple resume implemented using only html and css. 
The website is composed of three html pages (index.html, resume.html, and 
        bio.html) and one css page (sitestyle.css).
To the best of my knowledge, my code has been implemented correctly and passes
        all w3 validators.
Some problems I encountered were centering elements, both vertically and
        horizontally, which is most evident in index.html.
I received help from TAs Thomas Colgrove and Ryan Havens, who answered my CSS
        questions.
